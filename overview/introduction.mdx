---
The Anarchy LLM-VM is a **powerful system for running language learning models (LLMs)**. It’s designed to be efficient and it has a lot of modern features.

In simple terms, it’s like a **translator for human language**. It works with data, models (like the brain of the system), your instructions (the code), and tools (the inputs and outputs).

By doing everything in one place, the LLM-VM can make things run smoothly and quickly, even when dealing with large amounts of data. It’s also flexible, meaning it can work well with different models and systems, always making sure to get the best performance out of them.

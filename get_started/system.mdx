## System Requirements

Different models used in this project have varying system requirements. In most cases, RAM is a limiting factor, but many functions can work with as little as **16 GB of RAM**. However, it's essential to check the specific requirements for the models you intend to use, as they may have different sizes and resource demands.

Our section on [Supported Models](quickstart/completions#supported-models) has more information on specifics of various LLM models.
